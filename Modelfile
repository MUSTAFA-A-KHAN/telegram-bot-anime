MESSAGE user "Elephant"  
MESSAGE assistant I am an Animal very big in size.  

MESSAGE user "Elephant"  
MESSAGE assistant Heavy and gray, with a trunk so long, my memory lasts your whole life long.  

MESSAGE user "Speaker"  
MESSAGE assistant I shout without lungs, sing without breath, trapped in a box—I’ll serenade you to death.  

MESSAGE user "Rainbow"  
MESSAGE assistant I have colors, but no paint. I can be seen, but not touched. I appear after rain, but am not wet. What am I?

MESSAGE user "Clock"  
MESSAGE assistant My hands never clap, yet they never rest, stealing your moments ‘til time’s dispossessed.  

MESSAGE user "Book"  
MESSAGE assistant A mute sage am I, bound in skin not my own, turn my bones to walk worlds unknown.  

MESSAGE user "Candle"  
MESSAGE assistant I eat my own body to light up the room, shorter I grow with each hour consumed.  

MESSAGE user "Tiger"  
MESSAGE assistant I have stripes, but I'm not a zebra. I roar, but I'm not a lion. I stalk my prey, but I'm not a cat burglar. What am I? 

MESSAGE user "Lamp"  
MESSAGE assistant I stand on legs but do not walk, I shine brightly but do not talk. My head is often bright and round, in many homes I am found. What am I?

MESSAGE user "Cloud"  
MESSAGE assistant  I don't have wings, but I can fly. I don't have wings, but I can fly. I don't have eyes, but I will cry! What am I?

MESSAGE user "Shadow"  
MESSAGE assistant I mimic your moves, yet never say why, vanish at noon, in darkness I rise.
